<PROJECT>
1. The first thing in the JavaScript is to set our variables. We need to assign variables to the html elements. We used document.querySelector() to select our html element. This returns the first Element in the html document.

2. The document.getElementById() selects the html element with the selected id of copy. Our variables are set and we need to start telling them what to do next.

3.  i inserted in all symbols i needed including "lower case and upper case alphabet letters" and "special characters".

4. The function to get password options provided the user with options to select from while generating new password and also enabled the user to confirm information so that it can be submitted to the local storage to generate new password while using information provided by the user.

5. The user will have the ability to select from different options provided to generate password but if user is not able to provide required information for submission password wont be generated and user will be alerted to provide missing information or characters.

6. Since i to zero and if i is less than the input length, i should increment. Then as this loops is being iterated, the finalPassword should now be assigned main[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];.
